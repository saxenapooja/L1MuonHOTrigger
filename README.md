L1IntegratedMuonTrigger
=======================

Code for implementing and studying a L1 trigger that uses trigger primitive information from all muon subsystems and Hadron-outer calorimeter of CMS.

Requires a scram environment to run.

The usual spot for checking out the code would be in L1Trigger.

The following assumes you have run cmsenv.

mkdir -p $CMSSW_BASE/src/L1Trigger/L1IntegratedMuonTrigger

cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/L1Trigger/L1IntegratedMuonTrigger

git clone https://github.com/saxenapooja/L1MuonHOTrigger.git L1Trigger/L1IntegratedMuonTrigger/
